CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE


=======


# Simple simulation using openGL with the GLUT LIBRARY

THIS IS THE README FILE FOR ASSIGNMENT 1 PART 2 (GRAPHICS USING OPENGL)

The purpose of this was to learn and use openGL and the GLUT library and simulate conway's game of life. 



********************************

Living cells are green, dead cells are black. 

Specifications of cell life:




**********************************

Files

There is an game.cpp and gane.h file that contain the logic of the game (see the above specifications of cell life)

There is also a conway.cpp file that runs openGL and GLUT.

There is a makefile that compiles the cpp files together to make the executable and then runs it automatically.


**********************************

To Run

via Terminal (ON LINUX):


$ make
